Prop. & Description \\

P4 & \hi{Motion.} Users are bound to a network of roads, for
example the streets of a city. Only vehicles may directly travel along the
roads, whereas customers must be serviced by a vehicle. Both customers and
vehicles may enter the system at any time and anywhere.\\
\hline
P5 & \hi{Pick-ups and Drop-offs.} For a vehicle to service a customer, it
must first travel to the customer's origin to pick up the customer, and then to
the customer's destination to drop off the customer, in that order. The
customer enters the vehicle during the pick-up and exits the vehicle during the
drop-off. These visits must occur within the customer's time window.\\
\hline
P6 & \hi{Vehicle Seats.} When a customer enters a vehicle, the customer
occupies a number of seats equal to the customer's load. When it exits the
vehicle, it relinquishes the seats. At no time can the number of occupied seats
exceed the number of available seats in a vehicle.\\
\hline
P7 & \hi{User States.} A customer can be in one of three states at any
time: waiting for pick-up; in-transit following a pick-up but
before the drop-off; or arrived at destination. A vehicle can be either
in-service or out-of-service.\\
