\chapter{Appendix: Brief Primer on Relations}
\label{ap-primer}

The following briefly overviews the concept of relations and introduces some
notation.  Relations can be defined in terms of sequences and tuples.  A
sequence is an ordered list of elements.  We will write the integer sequence
from $i$ to $j$ as $i..j$. We will write the sequence $$(a_i)_{i\in
1..n}=a_1,a_2,...,a_{n-1},a_n$$ as $a_1..a_n$ or simply $a$ (without any
subscript). The number of elements in $a$ is called the length of $a$ and is
expressed as $|a|$.  A copy $b$ of sequence $a$ but with some elements removed
is called a subsequence.  Sequence $b$ is called a substring of $a$ only if
some $k$ exists such that $$b=a_{1+k}..a_{|b|+k},$$ in other words the elements
in $b$ form a contiguous subsequence of $a$.  We call sequence $a$ a tuple if
each element of $a$ is labeled. A labeled element is called a component.  A
function mapping an element based on its position in the tuple to a label is
called a labeling scheme.  Each component has a domain from which the component
takes its value, for example the set of real numbers.  A tuple of length $m$ is
called an $m$-tuple. A 2-tuple is called a pair.  A tuple definition will be
written as its labels surrounded by parentheses with the domains given. Label
names will be written in \texttt{typewriter} script to avoid confusion with
positional indices.

\begin{example}
\label{ex:tuple}
The sequence $a=a_\texttt{x},a_\texttt{y}$
is a 2-tuple with components named \texttt{x} and \texttt{y}.
The labeling
scheme for $a$ maps $1\rightarrow \texttt{x}$ and $2\rightarrow \texttt{y}$, with the
integers $1$ and $2$ referring to the position of the elements. A possible definition for
$a$ could be $a:=(\texttt{x},\texttt{y}),
a_\texttt{x}\in\mathbb{R}, a_\texttt{y}\in\{\textrm{pi},\textrm{Euler}\},$ and
a possible value for $a$ could be $$a=3.14,\textrm{pi}.$$
\end{example}

A set of unique $m$-tuples with the same labeling scheme is called an $m$-ary
relation, or simply relation.  Two operators can be applied onto
relations\footnote{Our model is not concerned with joins.}.  The selection
operator $\sigma_P(R)$ is a function that returns a subset $R'\subseteq R$ such
that predicate $P(R'_i)$ is true for each tuple $R'_i\in R'$.  The projection
operator $\pi_L(R)$ is a function that returns a copy $R'$ of $R$ such that
each tuple $R'_i\in R'$ is distinct, and only components with a label in set
$L$ are included.

Observe that an $m$-tuple is an $m$-ary relation with one element.
The projection operator thus naturally applies to tuples. For instance, see that for
$R=R_\texttt{x},R_\texttt{y}:=(\texttt{x},\texttt{y}),$
the $\texttt{x}$ component is extracted with
$R_\texttt{x}=\pi_\texttt{x}(R)$
and the $\texttt{y}$ component is extracted with
$R_\texttt{y}=\pi_\texttt{y}(R)$.
