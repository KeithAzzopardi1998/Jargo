This directory contains the LaTeX code for generating the pdf documentation.
The file body.tex is compiled from the noweb sources. You can edit it, but
BEWARE! Running 'make src' in the root directory will cause any changes made to
body.tex to be overwritten, and running 'make purge' will DELETE it. To be
safe, write your changes into the noweb files, then use 'make src' to
regenerate body.tex anytime you want.
