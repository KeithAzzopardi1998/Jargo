This directory contains Java source code for Jargo. These have been compiled
from the noweb files in src/. You can edit them, but BEWARE! Running 'make src'
in the root directory will cause any changes made to these files to be
overwritten, and running 'make purge' will DELETE them. To be safe, write your
changes into the noweb files, then use 'make src' to regenerate the Java files
anytime you want.
