Created October 25, 2019

This directory contains the source code for the StoragePerformanceTest program
and documentation. Both the program code and the LaTeX code are compiled from a
Noweb file, "src/StoragePerformanceTest.nw" using the Noweb commands "notangle"
and "noweave". See the "Makefile" for details.

IMPORTANT NOTE:
The test database "data/db" is not included in this repository because of its
size (~350 MB). If you would like a copy, send me an email.
