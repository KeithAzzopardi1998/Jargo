This directory contains example traffic functions to use with Jargo. Each
subdirectory contains the source code for one traffic function along with an
individual Makefile.

IMPORTANT: Before building, ensure jargors-1.0.0.jar exists in the /jar folder
of the Jargo root directory (../../jar).

To build one traffic function, change into the traffic function's directory
(e.g. cd random) and type `make`. A compiled jar will be output to this README
directory. The jar can then be imported into your own Jargo application (see
/example/app.java for an example) or used with Jargo Desktop
(/gui-launcher.sh).

To build all traffic functions at once, type `make` from this README directory.
