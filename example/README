This directory contains an example program for evaluating ridesharing
algorithms using the Jargo library. The algo/ and traffic/ subdirectories
contain example ridesharing algorithms and traffic functions, respectively.

IMPORTANT: Before building, ensure jargors-1.0.0.jar exists in the /jar folder
of the Jargo root directory (../jar). Also ensure at least one algorithm jar
and traffic function jar exist in algo/ and traffic/ subdirectories.

To build the program, type `make`. The compiled app.class will be output to
this README directory. The class can be executed using app-launcher.sh. To
build an algorithm or traffic function, view the READMEs in the algo/ and
traffic/ subdirectories.
