This directory contains example algorithms to use with Jargo. Each subdirectory
contains the source code for one algorithm along with an individual Makefile.

IMPORTANT: Before building, ensure jargors-1.0.0.jar exists in the /jar folder
of the Jargo root directory (../../jar).

To build one algorithm, change into the algorithm's directory (e.g. cd random)
and type `make`. A compiled jar will be output to this README directory. The
jar can then be imported into your own Jargo application (see /example/app.java
for an example) or used with Jargo Desktop (/gui-launcher.sh).

To build all algorithms at once, type `make` from this README directory.
