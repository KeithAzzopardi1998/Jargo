Jargo: Real-Time Stochastic Ridesharing Simulator                           src/
Latest Version: 1.0.0 (February 12, 2020) (in-development)

The subdirectories contain noweb sources organized by functionality. Here are
the descriptions:

  core/   Class-specific code chunks.
   cli/   Command-line interface main routine.
   gui/   Desktop program main routine.
   tex/   General-purpose code chunks and documentation.

DO NOT put source files in this directory. The 'src' build target will not
compile them because it only looks at the subdirectories. See 'makesrc.mk' for
details.
