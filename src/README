Jargo: Real-Time Stochastic Ridesharing Simulator                           src/
Latest Version: 1.0.0 (February 12, 2020) (in-development)

The subdirectories contain noweb sources. Here are the descriptions:

  core/   Class-specific code chunks.
   tex/   General-purpose code chunks, organized by functionality.
    ui/   User interface programs (command-line interface and GUI).

DO NOT put source files in this directory. The 'src' build target will not
compile them because it only looks at the subdirectories. See 'makesrc.mk' for
details.
