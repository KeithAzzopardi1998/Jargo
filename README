This directory contains the source code for the Jargo storage interface program
and documentation. Both the program code and the LaTeX code are compiled from a
noweb file, `src/Storage.nw` using the noweb commands `notangle` and `noweave`.
See the `Makefile` for details.

For those without notangle and noweave, the "weaved" `doc/Storage.tex` and
"tangled" `Storage.java` are provided.
