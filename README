This directory contains the source code for the Jargo client base program
and documentation. Both the program code and the LaTeX code are compiled
from a noweb file, `src/JargoClient.nw` using the noweb commands
"notangle" and "noweave".  See the `Makefile` for details.

For those without notangle and noweave, the "weaved" `doc/JargoClient.tex` and
"tangled" `JargoClient.java` are provided.

================================================================================
To build everything:
- Type `make`.

To build just the jar file (requires javac 11.0.1):
- Type `make jar`

To build just the pdf (requires pdflatex):
- Type `make pdf`
