This directory contains the source code for the Jargo simulation interface
program and documentation. Both the program code and the LaTeX code are
compiled from a noweb file, `src/SimulationInterface.nw` using the noweb
commands `notangle` and `noweave`.  See the `Makefile` for details.

For those without notangle and noweave, the "weaved"
`doc/SimulationInterface.tex` and "tangled" `SimulationInterface.java` are
provided.

================================================================================
