This directory contains the source code for the Jargo storage interface program
and documentation. Both the program code and the LaTeX code are compiled from a
noweb file, `src/StorageInterface.nw` using the noweb commands `notangle` and
`noweave`.  See the `Makefile` for details.

For those without notangle and noweave, the "weaved" `doc/StorageInterface.tex`
and "tangled" `StorageInterface.java` are provided.

================================================================================
