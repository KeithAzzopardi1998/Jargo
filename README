This directory contains the source code for the Jargo simulation control
program and documentation. Both the program code and the LaTeX code are
compiled from a noweb file, `src/SimulationController.nw` using the noweb
commands "notangle" and "noweave".  See the "Makefile" for details.

For those without notangle and noweave, the "weaved"
`doc/SimulationController.tex` and "tangled" `SimulationController.java`
are provided.

================================================================================
To build everything:
- Type `make`.

To build just the jar file (requires javac 11.0.1):
- Type `make jar`

To build just the pdf (requires pdflatex):
- Type `make pdf`
