Latest Version: 1.0.0 (March 24, 2020)

Jargo is a Java library that provides real-time ridesharing simulation. Its
goal is to help researchers evaluate the quality of ridesharing algorithms.
Jargo supports user-defined traffic, flexible vehicle routing, and various
out-of-the-box quality metrics. It is the second incarnation of Cargo
(https://github.com/jamjpan/Cargo).

The example/ folder has some sample programs demonstrating how to use Jargo.

Jargo uses literate programming with noweb. The noweb sources are provided, but
noweb itself is not necessary for building Jargo. Run 'make' in this directory
to see a list of build commands. See the INSTALL file for detailed build
instructions.

If you would like to compile the noweb sources, the notangle and noweave
programs can be obtained from the following website. If compiling noweb from
source, use icont instead of awk.
