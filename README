This directory contains the source code for the Jargo client base program and
documentation. Both the program code and the LaTeX code are compiled from a
noweb file, "src/client.nw" using the noweb commands "notangle" and "noweave".
See the "Makefile" for details.

For those without notangle and noweave, the "weaved" doc/client.tex and
"tangled" Client.java are provided.

================================================================================
To build everything:
- Type "make".

To build just the class file (requires javac 11.0.1):
- Type "make com/github/jargors/Client.class"

To build just the pdf (requires pdflatex):
- Type "make client.pdf"
