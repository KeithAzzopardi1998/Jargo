This directory contains the source code for the Jargo simulator interface
program and documentation. Both the program code and the LaTeX code are
compiled from a noweb file, "src/interface.nw" using the noweb commands
"notangle" and "noweave".  See the "Makefile" for details.

For those without notangle and noweave, the "weaved" doc/interface.tex and
"tangled" Interface.java are provided.

================================================================================
To build everything:
- Type "make".

To build just the class file (requires javac 11.0.1):
- Type "make com/github/jargors/Simulator.class"

To build just the pdf (requires pdflatex):
- Type "make simulator.pdf"
