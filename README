Latest Version: 1.0.0 (January 20, 2020) (in-development)
Build Status (master):

Jargo is a Java library for providing real-time ridesharing simulation
functionality. It aims to help researchers evaluate the quality of ridesharing
algorithms. Jargo supports configurable traffic conditions, flexible vehicle
routing, and 20 out-of-the-box quality metrics. It is the second incarnation of
Cargo (https://github.com/jamjpan/Cargo).

Jargo is written with literate programming. The idea is to write code that can
be compiled into a form understood by humans (English) and a form understood by
machines (Java). Developers write 'literate' code, and then use various
programs to compile the code. Jargo uses noweb. The workflow is:

                                    (java/*.java)        (jar/jargors-1.0.0.jar)
                  /- notangle -> Java source files -> javac -> Java bytecode
noweb source files
(src/*.nw,        \- noweave -> LaTeX source file -> pdflatex -> PDF document
  res/noweb.sty)                  (doc/body.tex)                (pdf/jargo.pdf)

The notangle and noweave programs can be obtained from
    https://www.cs.tufts.edu/~nr/noweb/

The pdflatex program can be obtained from most LaTeX distributions
such as TeX Live. The javac program can be obtained from the Java JDK.
