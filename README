This directory contains the source code for the Jargo storage interface program
and documentation. Both the program code and the LaTeX code are compiled from a
noweb file, "src/storage.nw" using the noweb commands "notangle" and "noweave".
See the "Makefile" for details.

For those without notangle and noweave, the "weaved" doc/storage.tex and
"tangled" Storage.java are provided.
