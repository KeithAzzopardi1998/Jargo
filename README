        Visit our website for tutorials and screenshots,

Latest Version: 1.0.0 (January 20, 2020) (in-development)

Jargo is a Java library for providing real-time ridesharing simulation
functionality. It aims to help researchers evaluate the quality of ridesharing
algorithms. Jargo supports configurable traffic conditions, flexible vehicle
routing, and 20 out-of-the-box quality metrics. It is the second incarnation of
Cargo (https://github.com/jamjpan/Cargo).

The example/ folder has some example programs demonstrating how to use Jargo.

Jargo is written with literate programming using noweb. The noweb sources are
provided, but noweb itself is not necessary for building Jargo. Run `make` in
this directory to see a list of build commands. See the INSTALL file for
detailed build instructions.

If you would like to compile the noweb sources, the notangle and noweave
programs can be obtained from
    https://www.cs.tufts.edu/~nr/noweb/
