Contributing

See something you don't like in the code? Wish a certain feature was
implemented? Now is your chance to become a contributor! Fork this repository
into your own GitHub account, then clone your fork onto your machine.  Make
whatever changes you want to your clone, then push your changes back to your
fork on GitHub. Visit https://github.com/jargors/Jargo/pulls to make a pull
request against your fork.

Contributors are encouraged to work on the noweb source files in the src/
directory so they can update the pdf while they are modifying the Java code.
But feel free to skip the noweb stuff and just edit the Java (and TeX) code
directly.

You can also create a new issue:
