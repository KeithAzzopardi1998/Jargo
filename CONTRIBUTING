Contributing

See something you don't like in the code? Wish a certain feature was
implemented? Now is your chance to become a contributor! Fork this repository
into your own GitHub account, then clone your fork onto your machine.  Make
whatever changes you want to your clone, then push your changes back to your
fork on GitHub. Visit https://github.com/jargors/Jargo/pulls to make a pull
request against your fork.

Feel free to skip the noweb stuff and just edit the Java (and TeX) code
directly. Or try editing the noweb source files in the src/ directory so you
can easily make changes to the documentation at the same time.

You can also create a new issue:
